Description: advanced HTML to text converter
 html2text is a converter from HTML to plain text.
 .
 html2text reads HTML documents supplied in the command line (or from standard
 input), converts each of them into a stream of plain text characters and
 writes output to the file or the terminal.
 .
 html2text was written because the author wasn't happy with the
 output of "lynx -dump" and so he wrote something better.
